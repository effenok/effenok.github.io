I am trying to start doing this blog, and also do some coding, so I thought of a rust project. I want to build a 
library for discrete event simulation similar to OmNet++, and then use it to show how to implement routing protocols.
Here is my developer log. 

## day 1

well, day one obviously consisted of
```
sudo apt install rustc 
```
and
```
GET /book HTTP/1.1
https://www.rust-lang.org/
```

Actually, I installed an Ubuntu VM for programming and installed [i3](https://i3wm.org/) on it. i3 is a lightweight minimalistic window 
manager. I have to say, i kinda like it, at least for a VM. 

If I was installing something on a host computer I would 
probably install a full featured desktop environment. Installing all necessary parts, like clock, calendar, 
notifications, screenshot manager would take too much time. Also, if i install all KDE applications, how much am I 
saving by not installing KDE? 

I also found several simulation libraries. The most promising is simrs [simrs](https://github.com/elshize/simrs), 
which will probably serve as a base for the simulation library.

## day 2

I made it to chapter 6 in [Rust book](https://www.rust-lang.org/book). Frankly speaking it would be nice if there 
was a book targeted people familiar with C/C++. I know that I will find a lot if I actually google, but there is 
something special in official doc.

I have read through the chapter on stack and heap. This was a point at which I was so glad I knew what stack  and 
heap actually are and what is the difference between allocating objects on stack and on heap. Followed this, I am 
struggling to understand when objects are created, copied, and moved. Well, i guess I am not a good C++ programmer 
either ...
